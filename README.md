# CYLINDER-USING-BEIZER-AND-EXTRUSION
# 1. Write a program to extrude following 3D shapes from basic 2D shapes:         A Cylinder of height (Y axis) 5H from a circle of radius R. Calculate 48 points. At h=0H, 1H, 2H, 3H, 4H and 5H   for angle=0,45,90,135,180,225,270 and 315.         Don't use inbuilt function to render the cylinder. Draw curved lines to connect the points. Implement Curved line function of your own using bezier curves.


TO COMPILE THE CODE:

1. g++ CYLINDER USING BEIZER AND EXTRUSION.cpp -o extrude -lglut -lGLU -lGL
2. ./extrude
